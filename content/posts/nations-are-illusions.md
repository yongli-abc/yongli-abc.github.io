一切国土皆幻住，想倒、心倒、见倒、无明所现故（《大方广佛华严经 入法界品 第一品》）。

巴以冲突，平民死伤无数。亚伯拉罕诸教的千年恩怨也还在延续。兴，百姓苦。亡，也百姓苦。唯愿世界上的一切政治家，在纵横谋划之余，亦还能垂眼看一看黎民百姓的悲苦与血泪。历史与世界不只有战略和大棋，更加还有无数家庭夫妻孩子猫猫狗狗的悲欢离合，梦想与日常。

给以色列红十字会和巴勒斯坦红新月会分别做了一点捐助，希望能以微薄之力，减去苦难一分。就连人道主义救援的组织也需要以不同名目示人，其背后延绵千年的裂痕与创伤，更可见一斑。

问题的答案往往不在题干里，战争的出路也不在战争本身。国土无自性，冲突也无自性，仇恨也无自性。起于微末的因缘，需要更加广大的包容和知见才能收容。

All nations are rooted in illusion, manifested by misguided thoughts, inverted hearts, misperceived sights, and ignorance. (from "The Avatamsaka Sutra, Entering the Dharma Realm, Chapter One").

The Israel-Palestine conflict has resulted in countless civilian casualties. The millennia-old grievances of the Abrahamic faiths continue. When nations rise, people suffer. When nations fall, people suffer too. May all politicians around the world, amid their schemes, also cast their eyes upon the sorrows and tears of ordinary people. History and the world consist not just of strategies and grand chess games, but also countless families, couples, children, cats, and dogs experiencing joys and sorrows, dreams, and daily lives.

I have made small donations to both the Israeli Red Cross and the Palestinian Red Crescent, hoping to contribute even slightly to alleviating suffering. Even humanitarian relief organizations must present themselves under different names, revealing the thousand-year-old fissures and wounds behind them.

The answer to the question is often not in the question itself; the way out of war is not in war either. Land has no inherent nature, conflicts have no inherent nature, and hatred has no inherent nature. Arising from minor causes and conditions, greater inclusiveness and understanding are needed to contain them.
